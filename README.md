**Epidemic-Behavior Interaction Model: Understanding Oscillatory Dynamics in Pandemic Response**

In this study, we introduce the **Epidemic-Behavior Interaction Model** (**EBIM**), a novel agent-based framework that captures the dynamic interplay between disease propagation and public behavior. Utilizing a two-layer network, the model simulates the spread of infectious disease using a Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (**SIS**) approach, while simultaneously modeling **behavior change** in response to infection rates. The model highlights how feedback loops between public health conditions and individual behaviorâ€”such as mask-wearing, social distancing, and vaccinationâ€”can lead to sustained **oscillatory patterns** in disease dynamics. We explore scenarios both with and without vaccination, revealing that oscillatory dynamics persist due to **delayed behavioral responses** and natural **recovery**. The inclusion of **vaccination** introduces additional feedback mechanisms, such as waning immunity, which further influences the cyclical behavior observed in the model. Our findings underscore the critical role of public behavior in pandemic management, especially in the absence of widespread vaccination. The EBIM offers valuable insights into the factors driving the **cyclical nature of pandemics**, providing a robust tool for policymakers to design timely and effective public health interventions. By incorporating **real-world data** and dynamic thresholds, the model could enhance our understanding of how populations respond to infectious disease threats and how these responses can be optimized to mitigate long-term impacts.
